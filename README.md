# Jenkins X Pipelines Visualizer

This is a Web UI for [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/), with a clear goal: **visualize the pipelines - and their logs**.

It was started at [Dailymotion](https://github.com/dailymotion-oss) and then moved inside the [Jenkins X Organization](https://github.com/jenkins-x) at [github.com/jenkins-x/jx-pipelines-visualizer](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-pipelines-visualizer) to get better support from the Jenkins X community, and be integrated by default in Jenkins X.

This repository is now empty and archived - please use [github.com/jenkins-x/jx-pipelines-visualizer](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-pipelines-visualizer) instead.
